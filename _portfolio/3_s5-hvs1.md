The star S⁵-HVS1 was observed as part of our general S⁵-Halo survey. It was discovered to have a radial velocity with respect to the Sun of over 1000 km&nbsp;s⁻¹, and a total velocity of the star in the Galactic rest frame of over 1700 km&nbsp;s⁻¹. It was first hypervelocity star that could be confidently associated with the Galactic Centre, and the first observed example of star ejected from the Galactic centre by the Hills Mechanism.
