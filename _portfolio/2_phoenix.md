One of our stream targets is Phoenix. Using the S⁵ observations we identified that this stream was formed from a destroyed globular cluster, and that its overall metallicity was below the previously observed metallicity floor of globular clusters. This shows that globular clusters can form at low metallicities and survive longer than we previously thought.
