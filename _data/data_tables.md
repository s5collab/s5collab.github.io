  * The best-fit stream and its associated orbit

###### [Koposov et al (2023)](https://doi.org/10.1093/mnras/stad551)  • Probing the Milky Way and Magellanic Clouds potentials with the 6D map of the Orphan–Chenab stream
There is a [Zenodo repository of data](https://zenodo.org/records/7644540) for the paper, incuding
    * The Stan models used to extract stellar stream properties
    * The measurement of radial velocity, stream track on the the sky, proper motions and stream densities for Orphan-Chenab.
    * The list of candidate OC stream members from S5 and other surveys. 
    * The best fit stream N-body model
    * The posterior chains from the stream/potential model.
    * The enclosed mass profiles for LMC and MW (figure 15 and 17 of the paper)
