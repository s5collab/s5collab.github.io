        desc: "This is the main survey of streams in the halo of the Milky Way. The goal is to measure radial velocities and metallicities of stream members. S⁵ made the first spectroscopic observations of the DES streams, and has now mapped over 20 streams both inside and outside of Dark Energy Survey footprint. The [First Public Data Release](#data) of the S⁵ was on April 24, 2021 containing data derived from all observations taken between 2018-2019."

      - title: "S⁵-Halo"
        desc: "We use about a third of our fibres for a Milky Way halo survey. This has the aim of observing interesting objects in the halo such as hyper-velocity stars, extremely metal-poor stars, RR Lyraes, and white dwarfs. It was as part of this survey we found [S⁵-HVS1, a star travelling 1700 km&nbsp;s⁻¹](#portfolio)."

      - title: "S⁵-Low<i>z</i>"
        desc: "Nearby faint galaxies are difficult to distinguish from the far more numerous background galaxy population via photometry alone. The goal of including low-redshift (low-z) galaxy targets in S⁵ is to increase the number of spectroscopically confirmed low-z galaxies in order to better train photometric selection algorithms, and help build a statistic sample of very low-z galaxies."

        desc: "We are also using Magellan/MIKE and ESO/UVES to obtain high-resolution spectra of bright stream members in order to derive stellar parameters and precise elemental abundances. These will enable us to understand the stream progenitors and chemical evolution. See our [publication list](#publications) for Ji *et al.* 2020 & 2021, Casey *et al.* 2021, and Hansen *et al.* 2021."
