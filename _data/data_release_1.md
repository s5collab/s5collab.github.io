###### The First Public Data Release of the Southern Stellar Stream Spectroscopic Survey was on April 24, 2021. 

S⁵ DR1 contains data derived from all observations taken between 2018-2019. For details on target selection, data reduction, survey validation see [Li *et al.* (2019)](https://doi.org/10.1093/mnras/stz2731) and [this PDF](documentation/S5DR1_Documentation(202104).pdf) for documenation and column descriptions of S⁵ DR1.

[DR1 can be downloaded from zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4695135). There are two versions of the DR1: `s5_pdr1.fits` which contains all columns; and `s5_pdr1_light.fits` which only contains the small subset with the most frequently used columns.
