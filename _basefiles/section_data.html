      <h3>Data Release 1</h3>
      <p>The First Public Data Release of the Southern Stellar
      Stream Spectroscopic Survey was on April 24, 2021.
      S<sup>5</sup> DR1 contains data derived from all observations
      taken between 2018-2019. For details on target selection,
      data reduction, survey validation see <a href=
      "https://doi.org/10.1093/mnras/stz2731">Li et al. (2019)</a>
      and see <a href=
      "documentation/S5DR1_Documentation(202104).pdf">this PDF</a>
      for documenation and column descriptions of S<sup>5</sup>
      DR1.</p>
      <p><a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4695135">DR1 can
      be downloaded from zenodo</a>. There are two versions of the
      DR1: <code>s5_pdr1.fits</code> which contains all columns;
      and <code>s5_pdr1_light.fits</code> which only contains the
      small subset with the most frequently used columns.</p>
      <p>If any data from this release is used for publication,
      please cite <a href=
      "https://doi.org/10.1093/mnras/stz2731">Li et al. (2019)</a>
      for reference and include the following text in your
      acknowledgments:</p>
      <blockquote>
        Based on data acquired at the Anglo-Australian Telescope.
        We acknowledge the traditional owners of the land on which
        the AAT stands, the Gamilaraay people, and pay our respects
        to elders past and present.
      </blockquote>

      <h3>Large data tables</h3>
      <p>We provide machine-readable versions of large tables
        published in our papers.</p>
