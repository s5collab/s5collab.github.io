      <p>Mapping stellar streams of the Milky Way with the
      Anglo-Australian Telescope</p>

      <p>S<sup>5</sup> is a spectroscopic survey that began in 2018
      using the 2dF/AAOmega spectrograph on the 3.9-metre
      Anglo-Australian Telescope at Siding Spring Observatory. The
      aim is to map the kinematics and chemistry of stellar streams
      in the Southern Hemisphere. The initial focus has been on
      recently identified streams within the footprint of the
      <a href="http://www.darkenergysurvey.org/">Dark Energy Survey
      (DES)</a>, with the eventual goal of surveying the entire
      southern sky.</p>
      <p>The streams represent material tidally striped from dwarf
      galaxies and globular clusters and hence are essential
      dynamical probes of the dark matter distribution of the Milky
      Way, as well as providing a detailed snapshot of its
      accretion history.</p>
      <p>The 350 science fibres of the 2dF fibre positioner, the
      precise photometry of DES DR1, and the superb proper motions
      from Gaia DR2 allow us to conduct an efficient spectroscopic
      survey to map these DES streams. In addition to the stream
      survey, we use spare fibres on each pointing to undertake a
      Milky Way halo survey, and a low-redshift galaxy survey.</p>

            <h3>S<sup>5</sup>-Streams</h3>
            <p>The main survey. The goal is to measure radial
            velocities and metallicities of stream members. So far
            S<sup>5</sup> has mapped 9 DES streams and 3 streams
            outside of DES; the former are the first spectroscopic
            observations of these recently discovered streams.</p>

            <h3>S<sup>5</sup>-Halo</h3>
            <p>We are able to use some spare fibres for a Milky Way
            halo survey. This has the aim of observing interesting
            objects in the halo such as hyper-velocity stars,
            extremely metal-poor stars, RR Lyraes, and white
            dwarfs.</p>

            <h3>S<sup>5</sup>-LowZ</h3>
            <p>Nearby faint galaxies are difficult to distinguish
            from the far more numerous background galaxy population
            via photometry alone. The goal of including
            low-redshift (low-z) galaxy targets in S<sup>5</sup> is
            to increase the number of spectroscopically confirmed
            low-z galaxies in order to better train photometric
            selection algorithms, and help build a statistic sample
            of very low-z galaxies.</p>

            <h3>S<sup>5</sup>-HiRes</h3>
            <p>We are also using Magellan/MIKE to obtain
            high-resolution spectra of bright stream members in
            order to derive stellar parameters and precise
            elemental abundances. These will enable us to
            understand the stream progenitors and chemical
            evolution.</p>
